## vocabulary
- **expression**: a non-empty sequence of literals, variables, operators, and function calls that calculates a single value.
- **evaluation**: The process of executing an expression.
- **result**: The single value produced by an expression.
- **expression statement**: a statement that consists of an expression followed by a semicolon.

```cpp
x = 5 //expression
x = 5; //expression statement
```

- **subexpression**: expression used as an operand. The subexpression of `x = 4 + 5` is `x` and `4 + 5` and the subexpression of `4 + 5` is `4` and `5`.
- **full expression**: An expression that is not a subexpression... so what makes this different than a regular expression?
- **compound expression**: An expression that contains 2 or more uses of operators. `x = 4 + 5` uses the `operator=` and `operator+`, and is therefore a compound expression.
