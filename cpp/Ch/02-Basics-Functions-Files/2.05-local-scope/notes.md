## Let's get to it. Should be short.

**local variables:** Variables defined inside the body of a function are defined locally (as opposed to globally)

**scope:** is where the identifier can be seen and used in the source code. Like a vampire needing to ask for permission to enter before being granted access. It isn't in his scope unless explicitly given permission to enter...

(Russian vampire-laugh): ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, Thank you for letting me into your scope!

**out of scope:** The opposite...

Scope is a compile-time property and trying to use an identifier when it isn't in scope, will result in a compile error.

The curly braces define the beginning and end of a variables scope.
