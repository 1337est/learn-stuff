## Pass by address for "optional" arguments

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void printIDNumber(const int *id=nullptr)
{
    if (id)
        std::cout << "Your ID number is " << *id << ".\n";
    else
        std::cout << "Your ID number is not known.\n";
}

int main()
{
    printIDNumber(); // we don't know the user's ID yet

    int userid { 34 };
    printIDNumber(&userid); // we know the user's ID now

    return 0;
}
```
```
Your ID number is not known.
Your ID number is 34.
```

This is straightforward. We set a default to `nullptr` for function `printIDNumber()`.

However, in many cases, function overloading is a better alternative to achieve the same result:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

void printIDNumber()
{
    std::cout << "Your ID is not known\n";
}

void printIDNumber(int id)
{
    std::cout << "Your ID is " << id << "\n";
}

int main()
{
    printIDNumber(); // we don't know the user's ID yet

    int userid { 34 };
    printIDNumber(userid); // we know the user is 34

    printIDNumber(62); // now also works with rvalue arguments

    return 0;
}
```

## Changing what a pointer parameter points at

When we pass an address to a function, that address is copied from the argument into the pointer parameter:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

// [[maybe_unused]] gets rid of compiler warnings about ptr2 being set but not used
void nullify([[maybe_unused]] int* ptr2)
{
    ptr2 = nullptr; // Make the function parameter a null pointer
}

int main()
{
    int x{ 5 };
    int* ptr{ &x }; // ptr points to x

    std::cout << "ptr is " << (ptr ? "non-null\n" : "null\n");

    nullify(ptr);

    std::cout << "ptr is " << (ptr ? "non-null\n" : "null\n");
    return 0;
}
```
This prints:
```
ptr is non-null
ptr is non-null
```

As you can see here, changing the address held by the pointer parameter had no impact on the address held by the argument (`ptr` still points at `x`). When function `nullify()` is called, `ptr2` receives a copy of the address passed in (in this case, the address held by `ptr`, which is the address of `x`). When the function changes what `ptr2` points at, this only affects the copy held by `ptr2`.

However, what if we wanted to allow a function to change what a pointer argument points to?

## Pass by address... by reference?

Just like we can pass a normal variable by reference, we can also pass pointers by reference:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

void nullify(int*& refptr) // refptr is now a reference to a pointer
{
    refptr = nullptr; // Make the function parameter a null pointer
}

int main()
{
    int x{ 5 };
    int* ptr{ &x }; // ptr points to x

    std::cout << "ptr is " << (ptr ? "non-null\n" : "null\n");

    nullify(ptr);

    std::cout << "ptr is " << (ptr ? "non-null\n" : "null\n");
    return 0;
}
```
```
ptr is non-null
ptr is null
```
