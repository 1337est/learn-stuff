## A general approach to debugging

Once the problem has been identified, debugging the problem generally consists of 6 steps
1. Find the root cause of the problem (usually the line of code that isn't working)
2. Ensure you understand why the issue is occurring (very important and make sure you don't move on until you understand why)
3. Determine how you'll fix the issue
4. Repair the issue causing the problem
5. Retest to ensure the specific problem has been fixed
6. Retest to ensure no new problems have emerged after fixing the specific problem

Basically most of this is common sense to me.
