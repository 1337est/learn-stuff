## Finding the problem with your eye holes

Most of the time debugging is looking for the error, not actually fixing it. The bug is usually trivial and easy to fix. You can use your eyes to find the problem via **code inspection**. Finding issues through your eye balls is easy enough with either code you've written or simple programs. However, when programs get more complex or your unfamiliar with the code, simple code inspection can be a bit hard when looking for a bug.

## Finding the problem by running the program

The approach of watching the behavior of the program as it runs, and trying to diagnose the issue from that, can be generalized as:
1. Figure out how to reproduce the problem.
2. Run the program and gather information to narrow down where the problem is
3. Repeat step 2, or step 1 and 2 if new problems occur.

## Reproducing the problem

Generate a set of **reproduction steps** which are clear and precise steps that can be followed to cause the issue/bug to occur with a high level of predictability. The goal here again, is to produce to problem to gather diagnostics on the issue.

## Homing in on issues

You try and pinpoint the bug through your diagnostics. It's not rocket science.
