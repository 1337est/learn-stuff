## Syntax and semantic errors
C++ is a quirky language.

- **syntax errors:** occur when you write a statement that isn't valid according to the grammar of the C++ language.

Examples of syntax errors would be like, missing a semicolon, or mismatching parentheses, or having a typo in your code.

- **semantic errors:** occur when a statement is syntactically valid, but doesn't do what you want it to do.

Examples of semantic errors would be like, division by 0, or using variable x when you wanted to use variable y instead, or using exponentiation vs multiplication on accident, etc.
